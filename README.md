# Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

**Key Technologies:**

* **Python:** Programming language.
* **scikit-learn:** Machine learning library (Logistic Regression, XGBoost).
* **pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** Numerical computing.
* **matplotlib:** Data visualization.
* **seaborn:** Statistical data visualization.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
    - Load the credit card transaction dataset.
    - Handle missing values and outliers.
    - Perform feature engineering (e.g., create new features, scale data).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Utilize pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn to:
        - Explore data distributions.
        - Identify potential correlations and patterns between features.
        - Visualize data to gain insights into fraudulent activities.

3. **Model Training:**
    - Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) on the preprocessed data.
    - Tune model hyperparameters for optimal performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
    - Assess model performance on unseen data (test set).

5. **Model Deployment (Optional):**
    - Deploy the trained model for real-time fraud detection in a production environment.

**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the credit card transaction dataset.
* `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
* `models/`: Stores trained models.
* `reports/`: Contains reports and visualizations summarizing the analysis and results.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the data and train the models.
